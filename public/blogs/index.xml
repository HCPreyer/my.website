      <description>Before joining LBS and reading for the Master in Financial Analysis, I did my undergraduate studies in International Business at Maastricht University. I deliberately chose to specialize in Finance with the possibility to investigate financial topics such as “Investment Decisions” and “Portfolio Management Theory”. Additionally, in my semester abroad at Hong Kong Polytechnic University, I deepened my knowledge at the Finance and Accounting department, where I studied theoretical understanding of “Merger and Acquisition” and “Risk Management”.</description>

      <description>The goal of this project was to illustarte the top 10 cities in California that donated most money to Trump and Clinton. First I saved two different dataframes CA_contributor and zipcodes in new varibales and merged them via left_join as one dataframe as CA_contributors only listed the zipcodes while the other one assigned the zipcodes to the cities. But first I had to transform the zipcodes into doubles to match the format of the zipcodes in the CA_contributor.</description>
